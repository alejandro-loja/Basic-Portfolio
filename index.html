        <p>Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Alejandro Loja. I was born and raised in Newark, NJ. I am
            currently
            taking
            coding bootcamp classes. My educational background is in chemistry and I am currently working for a flavor
            company.
            Essentialy, I am tasked to create new flavors for foods like ice cream, drinks, and other sweets. </p>
        <p>I like to tinker with things and it's one of the reasons that I am so excited to change my focus into
            something
            that
            will focus my ability like coding. My other interests are photography, and dancing salsa and bachata.
        </p>
