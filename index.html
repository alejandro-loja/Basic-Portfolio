    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Alejandro Loja. I was born and raised in Newark, NJ. I am currently taking
        coding bootcamp classes. My educational background is in chemistry and I am currently working for a flavor company.
        Essentialy, I am tasked to create new flavors for foods like ice cream, drinks, and other sweets. </p>
    <p>I like to tinker with things and it's one of the reasons that I am so excited to change my focus into something
        that will focus my ability like coding. My other interests are photography, and dancing salsa and bachata.
